    "In the code you provided, a 2D transformation matrix `M` is used to apply a perspective transformation to an image using the OpenCV library in Python. The `cv2.warpPerspective` function is used to perform this transformation.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. The third row of `M` is an identity row, which means no changes are applied to the z-axis (depth).\n",

    "\n",
    "By multiplying the original width (`cols`) and height (`rows`) of the image by 1.5, you are effectively scaling the image to 1.5 times its original size along both dimensions.
